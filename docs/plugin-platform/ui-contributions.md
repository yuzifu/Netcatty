# Plugin UI contributions

Status: internal preview (`0.1.0-internal`), development gate only

Phase 4 of [#2269](https://github.com/binaricat/Netcatty/issues/2269)
connects the manifest contribution contract to Netcatty's native UI and to a
separate sandbox for fully custom views. It does not expose Electron IPC, React
components, the main document, or a browser network stack to plugin code.

## Activation and ownership

Enabled plugins are not started merely because they contribute UI. The host
starts `onStartupFinished` plugins during contribution initialization and
otherwise activates a runtime when one of its declared commands, views, or
Providers is first used. `onCommand:`, `onView:`, and `onProvider:` therefore
share one idempotent supervisor boundary. Contribution IDs must begin with the
owning plugin ID. Plugin-created Context Keys use the exact owning plugin ID
followed by one local key segment; nested dot segments are rejected so plugin
IDs that share a prefix cannot claim each other's UI state.

The Provider seam also exposes an immutable, localized enumeration independent
of database internals and returns the current runtime identity after lazy
activation. PR 5 can therefore build and retire terminal Provider registries
without importing package-storage structures or guessing which activation owns
an in-flight request.

Disabling, replacing, or uninstalling a plugin first removes its contribution
surface and closes its custom views, then stops the runtime. Background work
lives in the runtime, not in a view, so closing one view does not stop an
otherwise active plugin.

## Native settings

Netcatty renders setting declarations with host-owned controls. The supported
controls are switches, radio/select/multiselect, text and password fields,
textarea, number and slider, color, font, file and directory paths, keybindings,
lists, and tables. The main process validates every write against the declared
control, options, numeric range, text pattern, and structured value schema. The
package validator applies the same constraints to declared defaults before a
plugin can install.

Plugin patterns use a deliberately restricted regular-expression subset:
lookarounds, backreferences, and quantified groups are rejected, and patterned
input has a small independent length limit. List and table values use a bounded
JSON Schema subset with explicit types, bounded arrays/strings/numbers, closed
object properties, `required`, `enum`, and `const`. `$ref`, `pattern`, custom
formats, conditionals, unevaluated properties, and executable extensions are
not accepted.

Application, device, workspace, host, and session values are keyed separately.
Context-aware host surfaces supply their own scope IDs; a central settings
surface without a current workspace, host, or session shows those fields as
contextual instead of reading or writing an ambiguous record. Settings and
restored view state are user-owned records with no foreign-key
cascade to installed package versions, so uninstall does not erase them. The
platform is unreleased, so both tables are part of the complete schema at
`user_version = 1`; there is no migration chain.

Secret settings never enter the settings table or a renderer snapshot. The
host stores plaintext only through the phase-3 safeStorage-backed secret store,
shows a configured indicator, and exposes an opaque `SecretRef` to the owning
runtime. Only non-secret fields explicitly declaring `sync: true` may be used by
the future encrypted sidecar sync phase.

## Commands, menus, and Context Keys

Commands are registered in the plugin runtime after activation and invoked
through the host's validated `plugin.command.execute` request. A plugin runtime
or custom view may execute only commands owned by the same plugin. The native
host provides command-palette, application-menu, host-context, terminal-context,
terminal-toolbar, and status-bar placements. Visibility, enablement, and checked
state are computed by the host before rendering; plugin HTML is never inserted
into a native menu or the React tree.

Context Key expressions use a bounded parser for literals, namespaced keys,
parentheses, `!`, `&&`, `||`, equality/ordering, `in`, and `not in`. There is no
JavaScript evaluation. Invalid, oversized, or over-complex expressions evaluate
to false. Plugin runtimes may update only one-segment keys in their own exact
namespace.

Platform keybindings are resolved by Netcatty and ignored while the user is
typing in an input, textarea, select, any contenteditable or textbox role, or a
Monaco editor surface. Command enablement is rechecked in the main process, and
renderer snapshots fail closed immediately when their host context changes, so
stale UI cannot execute a context-gated action. Menu placements display the
first active platform binding unless the manifest suppresses it, and holding Alt
selects the declared same-plugin alternate command. Application-menu
accelerators pass through a strict bounded parser before reaching Electron.

Terminal context-menu, toolbar, status-bar, and active-terminal keybinding
invocations receive host-owned `terminal.sessionId`, `terminal.status`,
`host.id`, `host.protocol`, and, when applicable, `workspace.id` Context Keys.
Toolbar and status-bar placements are evaluated against their own surface
contexts rather than sharing one renderer snapshot context. This gives the PR 5
Terminal Provider layer a stable session identity without exposing xterm or
allowing renderer-supplied plugin keys to override runtime-owned Context Keys.

## Sandboxed custom views

Each open custom view is a lazily created `WebContentsView` with:

- `sandbox: true`, context isolation, web security, and no Node integration;
- a private ephemeral session and a fixed black-hole proxy;
- browser permissions, downloads, popups, webviews, drag navigation, and
  navigation away from the registered entry document denied;
- a protocol token scoped to one plugin package;
- a CSP with `connect-src 'none'`, no frames, workers, objects, media, forms, or
  base-URL changes; and
- a Permissions Policy denying camera, microphone, location, display capture,
  USB, serial, HID, payment, fullscreen, and clipboard capabilities.

The protocol serves package files only. A view cannot load host runtime modules
or another plugin's package. The view instance is bound to the Netcatty window
that created it; another renderer window cannot resize, message, or close it.
Owner closure, plugin disable, setup failure, and host shutdown all dispose the
view and its protocol/session registrations.

Views declaring `retainContextWhenHidden` are hidden without destroying their
owner-bound `WebContentsView` and are restored with fresh bounds when reopened.
Retained views are still disposed on owner shutdown, plugin disable, runtime
quarantine, or host shutdown; the flag never extends ownership or permissions.

The preload exposes only `postMessage`, same-plugin `executeCommand`, state
get/set, runtime messages, and environment changes. It caches environment
updates before view code subscribes and uses an owner-checked getter as a
fallback, so late subscribers still receive their initial environment. Messages,
state, command arguments, and Context Key values use the exact bounded JSON
value boundary rather than relying on `JSON.stringify` coercion.

## Themes, localization, and accessibility

Localized manifest text is resolved by exact locale, language base, English,
default, then the first declared value. Native contribution labels are plain
text. Open custom views receive locale, light/dark/system theme identity,
host-owned CSS color tokens, reduced-motion preference, forced/high-contrast
preference, and subsequent environment changes. Theme-token mutations and
accessibility media-query changes are observed while the host is open, rather
than only at initial view creation. Netcatty retains the accessible
name and close control around every custom view; modal placements use dialog
semantics, while aside, panel, tab, and settings placements use named regions.

## SDK surface

`PluginContext` now provides:

- `settings.get`, `settings.update`, and `settings.onDidChange`;
- `commands.registerCommand` and same-plugin `commands.executeCommand`;
- `contextKeys.set`;
- view message/state methods; and
- current locale/theme/accessibility values plus `environment.onDidChange`.

These methods remain JSON-RPC control-plane operations. Terminal hot-path data
is intentionally deferred to PRs 5 and 6.
